Compressor & Decompressor using Java & Java Swing.

I developed a compressor and decompressor project using Java Swing, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. This software application provides a user-friendly interface for compressing and decompressing files.

Key Features:

File Compression: Implemented algorithms to compress files and reduce their size without losing data integrity. Supported compression algorithms may include popular ones like ZIP, GZIP, or LZ77.

File Decompression: Developed functionality to decompress compressed files and restore them to their original format and size.

User Interface: Designed an intuitive GUI using Java Swing, featuring components like buttons, menus, and file explorers to provide a seamless user experience. Users can easily select files to compress or decompress and choose compression settings.

Compression Settings: Provided options to customize compression settings, such as selecting the compression algorithm, setting compression levels, and choosing file formats.

Progress Tracking: Implemented progress indicators or progress bars to show the status of compression or decompression operations, allowing users to track the process.

File Management: Incorporated features to browse and select files from the local system, enabling users to compress or decompress specific files or entire directories.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to handle any issues that may arise during the compression or decompression process, such as invalid file formats or insufficient disk space.

The project utilized Java Swing to create an interactive and visually appealing interface, providing an easy-to-use compression and decompression solution.

This compressor and decompressor project simplifies the process of compressing files to save storage space and decompressing them to restore their original format. It offers a convenient and efficient solution for managing files, benefiting users who need to compress or decompress data in various scenarios.
